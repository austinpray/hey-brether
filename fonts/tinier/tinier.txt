My fonts are all free.  You can use them for personal or commercial projects,
and I ask for no money.  I would, however, love to hear from you.  If you use
my fonts for something please e-mail me letting me know how you used it.  Send
me a copy if you can or let me know where I can find your work. You are under
no obligation to do this, I just like to see how my fonts get used.

A license.txt file should have been included with this font, explaining the
license under which it is made available. You can also read it at:

About the font:

Here is an even smaller pixel font than Tiny!  In order to squeeze it down one
more pixel I had to give up on a few things.  This font is all caps.  Also, not
all symbols are included and some characters are exact copies of others. But,
hey, you can write at 3 pixels tall!
